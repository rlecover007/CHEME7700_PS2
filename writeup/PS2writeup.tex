\section*{Problem 1}
I confirmed that my network was balanced through the use of \texttt{checkAllBalances()}, a function which goes through all reactions in the network and confirms that an equal number of atoms of each species are found as reactants and products. Reactions where a species disappears (exchange fluxes) are not balanced, and neither is the biomass production reaction, as biomass is a fictitious species, used to quantify cell growth. Through the use of dynamic flux analysis and the bounds given on oxygen update, glucose uptake, and growth rate, I was able to predict with a high degree of accuracy the rate at which E. coli would uptake glucose, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:aerobic}. By setting the maximum oxygen uptake rate to zero, I was able to predict the anaerobic fluxes, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:anaerobic}. I used an initial biomass concentration of .001 g/L, since this gave a good fit to the glucose uptake and biomass curve, since no initial value was given by Palsson. Initial concentrations of all species other than glucose and acetate were assumed to be zero, and initial concentrations of glucose and acetate were set based on the data in figure 7 of \cite{varma1994stoichiometric}.

There are two ways in which E. coli can generate ATP-through substrate level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation. Substrate level phosphorylation generates ATP by reactions between organic molecules, whereas oxidative phosphorlation uses ATP synthase with a proton gradient to produce ATP \cite{conway2015metabolism}. When E. coli uptake glucose, they invest two ATP convert it to pyruvate, though either gycolysis (Emden-Myerhoff Parnas), pentose phosphate, or Enter Doudoroff pathways. Going through glycolysis increases the amount of ATP available, as it produces 2 ATP for each glucose molecule processed. If oxygen is not present, this pyruvate is used for fermentation, which uses substrate level phosphorlation to produce ATP. While fermentation is faster than oxidative phosphorlation, it is not as energetically efficient \cite{conway2015metabolism}. When oxgyen is available, the pyruvate generated through glycolysis can continue through the citric acid cycle, which produces NADH that carries electrons the electron transport chain (which requires an electron acceptor, like oxygen to run), which produces the proton gradient necessary to run ATP synthase \cite{biobook}. 

If we examine the flux profiles in the aerobic and aerobic environments, without applying the bounds given by Palsson's experimental data, we observe that glucose uptake rates are the same, but the flux through biomass production is much larger in the aerobic case, suggesting that energetic species are available for non-essential reactions, like growth. \texttt{R\_atp}, which is represents the creation of ATP by ATP synthase has no flux through it in the anaerbic case, as expected, and a fairly large flux through it in the pretense of oxygen. Instead, there is a higher flux through reactions that produce ATP through substrate level phosphorolation such as \texttt{R\_pgk} and \texttt{R\_pyk}. Furthermore, in the anaerobic case, ethanol and formate are exported from the cell, which is not observed in the aerobic case. The complete flux profiles for both cases are given in the supplemental material.
